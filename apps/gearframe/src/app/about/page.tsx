      Hello! My name is Patrick and I'm currently working as an Associate
      Software Engineer II at JPMorgan Chase & Co. where I specialize in React
      TS development. Over the years I've had many random ideas of software
      tools that could be helpful in my everyday life and hobbies. I finally
      decided to put together a website to try to create some of these software
      tools, since it's a great way for me to practice my programming skills in
      ways that I might not be able to do in my day job. I've also always had an
      interest in graphic design, but don't have much design freedom at work, so
      I wanted to use this website as an opportunity to be creative with my UI
      design and to learn new things. I have a few tool ideas on the way. Keep
      an eye out on each tool page for updates on my progress.
      <br />- Patrick
